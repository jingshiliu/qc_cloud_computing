This project is to create a K8s cluster, deploy a containerized application in the cluster, and scale the pods.

Here are the detailed steps:

Task 1: Launch a Kubenetes cluster. You will need to configure the cluster with one master and at least two workers. You can build your own cluster from scratch on virtual machines, or use cloud-based Kubernetes services such as AWS EKS, Azure Kubernetes Service, or Google Kubernetes Engine.

Task 2: Deploy a contaierized application which run multiple instances of the same container.

Task 3: Scale the pod to more container instances.

Task 4: Update the application with a new software version.

Task 5: Delete the application and stop the Kubenetes cluster.
