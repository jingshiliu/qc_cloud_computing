Here is a specification of the steps, commands, observations, and problems I faced.
I used AWS CLI V2 shell to do the operations.
The key-pair I created is named: cloudp0
Cost Estimation Detail is in Step 7, Total is $0.00232

Step 2: Create Instance	from Preconfigured AMI			2:46
	Command: aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0ff8a91507f77f867 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name cloudp0
	
	Pre-configured AMI: ami-0ff8a91507f77f867
	Returned Values:
		Instance ID: i-08dcbf8495766346f
		Public DNS Name: ec2-44-197-246-116.compute-1.amazonaws.com

	Observation:
		--key-name parameter is not required to create the instance, but it is needed to ssh into the instance.
		Forgetting to add the --key-name parameter will throw an error about (publickey) that stops user to access
		the instance. Therefore, do not skip it.

Step 3:	Wait the Instance to be initialized			2:48
	Command: ssh -i cloudp0.pem ec2-user@ec2-35-174-207-107.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Step 4: Download some app on Linux 				2:50
	sudo yum install -y perl emacs
	logout

	Observation:
		Linux stops user to download apps directly unless you are the root user.
		Adding keyword "sudo" will do the command as root user.


Step 5: Create Image						2:51
	aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-08dcbf8495766346f --name cloudp0_test_image
	Returned Values:
		AMI ID: ami-0f342d7605fcdee91
	
	Observation: 
		Before moving to Step 6, you must wait until the AMI is been created and is in available state, 
		because creating new AMI involves copying data from the instance. Therefore, terminating the instance 
		before the AMI is available, will cause AMI to stuck in pending state forever. Additionally, instance 
		is not usable during the creation of AMI.

Step 6: Terminate Instance from Step 2				2:56
	Create Instance base on the newly created ImageID
	AMI from Step 5 is pending, waiting to be available	
	
	Command: aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-id i-08dcbf8495766346f	
		 aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0f342d7605fcdee91 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name cloudp0
	Returned Values:
		Instance ID: i-01bdb9a7c84d50f90
		 
	Observation:
		Sometimes, it ask for SnapshotID or Volume size. Not sure why it happens, maybe due to the instance terminated 
		before the AMI is available. 
Step 6.5: Terminate the New Instance
	Command: aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-id i-01bdb9a7c84d50f90

Step 7: Compute cost						2:58
	
	Instance Type		Hourly Rate(On demand)		Charge Basis
	t2.micro		$0.0116				Per-second
	
	First Instance(Step 2 - 6) run time: 10 min (2:46 - 2:56)
	Second Instance(Step 6)	   run time: 2 min (2:56 - 2:58)
	Total Run Time: 12 min
	Total Cost: (12 min/ 60 min) * $0.0116 = $0.00232


Step 8: Clean up
	Command:
		aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-0f342d7605fcdee91
		aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-033528c08e92417f9
